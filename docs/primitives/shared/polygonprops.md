| `sideLength` | `100`   | The length of each side (_optional_). |
| `size` | `0`   | Fit the shape to a circumscribed circle of a given diameter (_optional_). |

> [!TIP]
> When defining any regular polygon, you can specify either `sideLength` or `size`. If you define both, `size` will take precedence, and is defined as the diameter of the circumscribed circle around the polygon.
